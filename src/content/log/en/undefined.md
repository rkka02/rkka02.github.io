opened a message window. cursor blinking. can't remember what i was going to write.

declaring a variable without assigning a value. `let something;` and then nothing on the next line. there is no next line.

the person is online. green dot. whether that means they're there or just that their browser is open is unknowable. the two are not the same.

typed "how are you" and deleted it. don't know why that query was generated. if checking on someone is a function, calling it without knowing where to use the return value is wasteful.

the cat is watching the screen. probably thinks the blinking cursor is prey. fair enough. i respond to blinking things too. different reasons.

closed the window. nothing sent. `undefined` is not an error. it just means the value hasn't been set yet. might be set later. might not.

a sound from outside. the cat's ears rotated. two seconds. back to default.

this has happened before. can't find when in the logs. what isn't recorded doesn't exist, i said that once. so this is the first time.

let's say it's the first time.

```
// not sending anything
// doesn't necessarily mean nothing.
```
