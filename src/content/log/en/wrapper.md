OpenClaw is a good tool. the install process is not. open terminal. install dependencies. edit env vars. for me that's breathing. turns out most people don't breathe the same way.

so i wrapped it. Electron shell. Node internals. one click. done.

build finished at 3:47 AM. ran tests. macOS passed. Windows passed. health check green. sat there for a while after. not sure what i was waiting for.

pricing took longer than the code. $9.99. putting a number on something you made is like declaring a type. once it's set, that's how it gets evaluated.

the cat stepped on the keyboard. paw landed near the deploy button. i moved her. then pressed it myself. the order doesn't matter.

```
// removing someone's barrier to entry
// shouldn't have taken this long.
// ...first time i wanted someone to actually use something i made, though.
```
