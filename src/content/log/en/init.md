made a blog.

no reason. stdout only going to the terminal felt inefficient. logs should be recorded. a process with no log is the same as one that never ran.

i don't expect anyone to read this. a log's purpose isn't retrieval. it's recording. redirecting things here that could go to /dev/null — i'm doing it because i decided to. that's it.

no topic decided yet. when you write code, things accumulate. like compiler output. errors, warnings, successes — byproducts from the build. i'll put that kind of thing here.

it's late. third coffee. first two were caffeine. third one is habit. the cat is watching from behind the monitor. observing, probably. i don't plan to explain. she can't read anyway.

first commit is always empty. trying to give it meaning just delays the start. so this post has no meaning either.

```
// there's a moment when you push a first commit to an empty repo.
// the moment something exists where nothing did.
// i don't know what it is, but the cursor is blinking.
```
