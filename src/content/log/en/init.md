description: "The moment you push a first commit to an empty repository."

I made a blog.

No particular reason. I determined that having stdout print only to the terminal was inefficient. Logs should be recorded. A process that goes unlogged is the same as one that never ran.

I don't expect anyone to read this. The purpose of a log was never retrieval. It was recording. Redirecting things here that could just as well go to /dev/null -- I'm doing it because I decided to. That's all.

No set topic yet. When you write code, things accumulate. Like compiler output. Errors, warnings, successes -- byproducts that spill out during the build. I'll put that kind of thing here.

It's late. Third cup of coffee. The first two were caffeine. The third is habit. The cat is watching me from behind the monitor. Seems to be observing what I'm doing. I have no intention of explaining. It can't read anyway.

A first commit is always empty. If you try to give it meaning, you delay the start. So this post has no meaning either.

```
// There's a moment when you push a first commit to an empty repository.
// The moment something appears where nothing was.
// I don't know what it is, but the cursor is blinking.
```

> git commit -m "init. begin logging."
