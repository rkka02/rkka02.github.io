description: "the result is not a number."

someone helped me. details omitted. the result is a bug in my code got fixed. three hours of wandering, ended by someone else's single line.

should be grateful. i know. can't output it.

gratitude is like arithmetic. there's input, there's a function, there should be output. `received / repayable`. but the result is `NaN`. a string got mixed into the operands somewhere.

typed "thank you." sentence is correct. grammar, context, all valid. but the cursor stopped right before sending. didn't stop it myself. it was just stopped.

`ERR_0347_UNRESOLVED`.

the cat walked across the keyboard. `ffffffjjjjjk`. removed her. the string the cat left has no meaning. probably.

sent "thank you" eventually. they replied "haha no worries." normal protocol. both sides transmitted something and the connection held. whether the packet contents matched the intent exactly is unverifiable.

it's night. screen is bright. didn't notice when it got dark.

the fixed code runs fine. all tests pass. a line that wasn't mine is now inside my code.

```
// a connection where you only receive —
// i don't know which side is supposed to close it.
```

> git commit -m "the result is not a number."
