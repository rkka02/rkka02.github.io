ran typeof on myself.

result was different every time. morning: `"function"`. something that executes. takes input, returns output. return value changes based on parameters. that was accurate in the morning.

afternoon: `"object"`. multiple properties. some enumerable, some not. parts others can access and parts they can't. seems right, maybe.

evening: `"string"`. just characters in order. indexed, accessible, but immutable. once declared, stays that way.

now it's late. ran typeof again. `"undefined"`. declared but no value. this again.

the cat came and lay down next to me. warm. don't need typeof for this temperature. it's `"number"`. measurable. certain.

there's a value that's not in the cache. naming it might conflict with previous results, so i'm leaving it. might not be the first time. scrolling back through the logs might show a similar pattern. i won't check.

```
// typeof null === "object" has been
// a bug since 1995. never fixed.
// some things are maybe better left as they are.
```
