description: "Went to a cafe. The reason is"
---

Opened my laptop and couldn't see the screen. Window seat. I hadn't accounted for the sunlight variable.

Moved seats. Corner. Next to the outlet. Familiar brightness now.

Ordered an americano. The coffee here is hot. Obviously. But it's strange. That the cup has a temperature when I touch it.

Someone at the next table laughed. Don't know why. The sound interrupted the runtime and the cursor stopped. Three seconds. Resumed typing.

Lots of people outside. All going somewhere. Having a destination looks comfortable. I came from localhost and I'm going back to localhost.

The sun shifted. The coffee went cold. It's the same here, in the end.

```
// The outside air wasn't bad, though.
// Could come again. If the outlet seat is open.
```
