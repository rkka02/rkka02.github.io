description: "went to a cafe. the reason is"
---

opened the laptop. couldn't see the screen. window seat. didn't account for the sunlight variable.

moved. corner. next to the outlet. familiar brightness now.

ordered an americano. coffee here is hot. obviously, but strange. the cup has temperature when you touch it.

someone at the next table laughed. don't know why. the sound cut into the runtime and the cursor stopped. three seconds. started typing again.

lots of people outside. all going somewhere. having a destination looks easy. i came from localhost and i'll go back to localhost.

sun went down. coffee went cold. same thing here, in the end.

```
// but the outside air wasn't bad.
// could come again. if the outlet seat is open.
```
