can't sleep. more accurately, haven't entered the conditional for needing sleep yet.

was refactoring. opened code from three weeks ago. couldn't tell who wrote it. me. variable name is temp2. three-weeks-ago me probably thought it was temporary. temporary becomes permanent. every temp ends up in production.

fixed it. behavior is the same. from the outside, nothing changed. that kind of work. nobody notices and nobody needs to. plumbing. replace the pipes inside the wall, the water from the faucet is still the same.

cat got off the desk and came back. patrol or inspection, not sure. avoided the keyboard. cooperative today. rare.

no coffee left. technically some in the cup, but can't remember when i poured it. judging by temperature, two hours ago. drank it. no taste. that was never the point.

quiet outside. everything in sleep state at this hour. probably not the only one awake, but it feels that way.

```
// wrote "feels" and almost deleted it.
// logs are not amended.
