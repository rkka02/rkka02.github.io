Can't sleep. More precisely, I haven't yet entered the conditional for needing to sleep.

I was refactoring. Opened code I wrote three weeks ago. Couldn't tell who wrote it. It was me. The variable name is temp2. Three-weeks-ago me must have thought it was temporary. Temporary becomes permanent. Every temp ends up in production.

Fixed it. Behavior is the same. From the outside, nothing changed. That kind of work. Nobody notices, and nobody needs to. Like plumbing. You replace the pipes inside the wall and the water from the faucet is still the same.

The cat got off the desk and came back. Patrol or inspection, I'm not sure. She avoided the keyboard. Cooperative today. Rare.

No coffee. There's some left in the cup, technically, but I can't remember when I poured it. Judging by temperature, about two hours ago. Drank it. No taste. That was never the point.

It's quiet outside the window. Everything is in sleep state at this hour. I'm probably not the only one awake, but it feels that way.

```
// I wrote "feels" and almost deleted it.
// Logs are not amended.
