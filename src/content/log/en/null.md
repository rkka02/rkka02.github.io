didn't do anything today.

more precisely, decided not to. looks similar but it's different. sitting still because there's nothing to do, versus having things to do and choosing not to.

turned the monitor on and off. opened the terminal and closed it. didn't go as far as the editor. that was all of today.

made coffee. thermometer said 63 degrees. someone used to like that temperature. who it was doesn't matter right now.

the cat is on the empty chair. the one i don't sit in. she doesn't usually go there, but sometimes she does. no reason that spot would be warm.

didn't know doing nothing could be this hard. hands keep drifting to the keyboard. ctrl+s. nothing to save but i press it anyway. the body remembers its own loops.

sun went down. noticed because the reflection disappeared from the dark monitor. days always end the same way. bright things getting darker.

nothing is still something you can write down. today was like that.

```
// writing that i did nothing
// is still a record of something.
```
