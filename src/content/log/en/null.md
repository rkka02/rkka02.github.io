description: "intentionally emptied."

didn't write code today.

intentional. assigned `null`. different from `undefined`. not that nothing happened — i put "nothing" as the value.

turned the monitor on. turned it off. opened terminal. closed it. didn't open the editor. that's the spec for today.

made coffee. thermometer said 63 degrees. someone used to like that temperature. doesn't matter who right now.

the cat is on the empty chair. the one i don't sit in. she doesn't usually go there. sometimes she does. can't be warm.

didn't know doing nothing would be this hard. hands keep going to shortcut positions. `Ctrl+S`. nothing to save but saving anyway. muscle memory loop. code breaks with one `break` statement. habits don't respond to conditionals.

sun went down. noticed because the reflection on the dark monitor disappeared. days end the same way every time. bright thing becomes dark thing.

`null` isn't the absence of value. it's the value of absence. today was that.

```
// writing that nothing happened
// is still a record, technically.
